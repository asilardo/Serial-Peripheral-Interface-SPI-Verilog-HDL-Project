# Serial-Peripheral-Interface-SPI-Verilog-HDL-Project
______________________________________________________________

-This is a second semester project I had for Modern Digital System Design

-Serial Peripheral Interface was created with Verilog

-The interface consists of 32 test cases which must pass in order for all the data to be read

-The GTKWave shows the numbers going from right to left which corresponds with the data
